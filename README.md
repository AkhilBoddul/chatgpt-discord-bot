# discord-chatgpt
A simple Discord bot which uses ChatGPT API.

It has the following features: -

  1) Uses the latest GPT model, i.e., gpt-3.5-turbo.
  2) Remembers previous conversation history of a particular user and gives responses based on it.
  3) A user can delete his/her conversation history by using !clearhistory command to minimize token usage.
  4) Bypasses Discord's 2000 characters limit while generating responses by splitting long messages into separate messages.
  5) Multiple users can join the Discord server and enjoy with the ChatGPT bot for free as it uses only a single OpenAI API key :)
